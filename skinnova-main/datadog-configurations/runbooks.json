Validate Networking & Dependencies\n\n* Check:\n\n  * Load balancer health\n\n  * DNS resolution\n\n  * Firewall or security group changes\n\n* Confirm upstream dependencies (Vertex AI, third-party APIs) are operational\n\n---\n\n## Remediation Actions\n\nBased on findings, take appropriate action:\n\n* Restart affected containers or services\n\n* Roll back faulty deployments\n\n* Scale resources if under-provisioned\n\n* Fix misconfigurations (NGINX, routing, TLS)\n\n* Restore networking connectivity\n\n---\n\n## Post-Recovery Validation\n\nAfter remediation:\n\n* Confirm the website is accessible from multiple regions\n\n* Ensure synthetic uptime checks return to **PASS**\n\n* Verify error rates and latency stabilize\n\n* Monitor SLO burn rate for at least 15\u201330 minutes\n\n---\n\n## Documentation & Follow-Up\n\n* Record incident details:\n\n  * Root cause\n\n  * Time to detect\n\n  * Time to resolve\n\n* Create a follow-up task if:\n\n  * A deployment caused the outage\n\n  * Automation or alerts can be improved\n\n* Update this runbook if gaps were identified"
